          Too many people look at the holes in their life and miss the glorious
          bagel right in front of them.

            There's no denying that the best day of the week is
            <span
              class="font-weight-bold black--text"
              style="background-color:orange;"
            >
              Friday </span
            >. Sorry, Monday through Thursday â€” you're just the hurdles we have
            to get through to reach the weekend, and it really does start with
            Friyay. As exciting as it is to reach the end of the work week, the
            best part is when your office has
            <span
              class="font-weight-bold black--text"
              style="background-color:orange;"
            >
              Bagel Fridays </span
            >. It's that little tasty incentive that makes your morning so much
            brighter, and when you're too hyped to handle it all, you'll need
            some Instagram captions for bagel Friday pics.
